# Return Every 3rd Letter Application

While I was not able to use a POST request, I was able to create a simple form and use that input to return every 3rd letter as a JSON String.

For example, if you enter iamyourlyftdriver into the input box, and then hit the button, it will return as a JSON string {return_string: muydv).

Thanks so much for your consideration!
